### day 1

Constructing environments from Github issue Pull Request (PR) pairs from the Github Security Advisory database. Will use JUnit XML as it will provide stable identifiers like test names, timestamps, good error messages, F2P/P2F, and easy parsing (also Deepseek V-3.2 technical report uses it).
